# Time-To-Read
A simple program to calculate the time it takes to read a book.

# Dependencies
pip install epub-conversion
pip install pdfminer

Those are the only 2 depencies you need.

This program currently supports: An estimate based on pagecount, epubs, pdfs, and a .txt file (Idk who reads in that tho)
If you want to calculate the length of another format such as a .mobi you could try to use an online conversion tool to convert it to a epub

The current way it calculates a pdf is ridiculously slow but I dont know any other way, if you have a better way please let me know!
